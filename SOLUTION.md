# Meme Generator Issue - SOLVED

## The Problem
Your meme generation is stuck because:
1. Frontend publishes messages via WebSocket to **Core NATS** (subject: `meme.request`)
2. Backend listens to **JetStream** consumer (same subject, but different system)
3. Messages never reach the backend because Core NATS and JetStream are separate

## Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Restart everything fresh (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Delete the stuck consumer and stream
kubectl exec -n messaging nats-0 -c nats -- sh -c 'nats stream delete MEMES --force'

# 2. Restart backend to recreate stream
kubectl rollout restart deployment/meme-generator -n meme-generator

# 3. The backend will recreate the stream and consumer
```

### Option 2: Modify backend to use Core NATS
Change the backend to subscribe directly to Core NATS instead of JetStream.

### Option 3: Add a message bridge
Deploy a service that forwards Core NATS messages to JetStream.

## Why This Happened
- NATS has two messaging systems: Core NATS (pub/sub) and JetStream (persistent)
- WebSocket connections publish to Core NATS by default
- Your backend expects JetStream messages
- The 200 pending messages are stuck because they were never properly consumed

## To Test After Fix
1. Access http://meme-generator.local
2. Enter a prompt and click Generate
3. Check backend logs: `kubectl logs -n meme-generator deploy/meme-generator -f`
4. You should see messages being received and processed

## Long-term Solution
Either:
- Modify frontend to publish to JetStream (complex)
- Modify backend to use Core NATS subscriptions (simpler)
- Keep both and add proper message bridging
