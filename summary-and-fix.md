# Summary of Issues and Fix

## Current Issues:
1. **WebSocket publishes to Core NATS, not JetStream** - This is why messages show as "pending" but never get consumed
2. **Backend uses JetStream consumer** - Which only sees JetStream messages, not Core NATS
3. **Insufficient logging** - Making it hard to debug the flow

## Quick Fix:
Instead of modifying the backend code, we can:

1. **Create a NATS-to-NATS bridge** that forwards Core NATS messages to JetStream
2. **Or modify the backend** to listen to Core NATS directly

## The Real Issue:
When you publish via WebSocket to NATS, it goes to Core NATS subjects. JetStream is a separate layer that requires explicit publishing using JetStream APIs.

## Immediate Solution:
1. Deploy a simple forwarder that subscribes to Core NATS and publishes to JetStream
2. This will bridge the gap between WebSocket (Core NATS) and backend (JetStream)

## Long-term Solution:
- Modify frontend to use JetStream publish
- Or modify backend to use Core NATS subscriptions
- Add comprehensive logging throughout the chain
